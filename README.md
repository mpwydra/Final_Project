# Côte d'Ivoire

This is my final project on Côte d'Ivoire:

Starting from a high-up view of the country, we saw that most of the population condensed in more urban areas (or, at least, places that I knew were highly popular). This was shown with the following plot:

Places closer to the border with Liberia and Guinea 9as well as the capital city and surrounding area of Abidjan) were highly and densely populated (amount and amount per square kilometer, respectively). Whereas closer to the center of the country seemed to be more sparsely populated.
